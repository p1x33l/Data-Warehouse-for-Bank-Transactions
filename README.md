# Data Warehouse Project: 

## Extract, Transform &amp; Load Process Implementation on Bank Transactions Dataset

This project is a data warehousing solution for bank transactions, built using Talend for extract, transform and load (ETL) processes and Tableau for data visualization. The objective of the project is to extract, clean and load transaction data into a centralized data repository for analysis and reporting. The final outcome is a visually appealing and insightful dashboard created in Tableau, allowing users to easily explore and understand the underlying patterns and trends in the bank transaction data.
